Hey there mysterious viewer!

It's odd that you're here looking at this because I found this to be pretty boring and not much of use to others.
However, I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to these things so I'm trying to complete all of this no matter how trivial it is.

A bit about me, my name is Tristan and I am a male student who enjoys coding, technology, games, and to be honest, an avid anime watcher. On my life though,
I am a normal upstanding human being and don't make cringe videos on it. I just like the stories and messages behind some of them.
You can check my Kaize.io (basically MyAnimeList) profile if you think I'm lying. (https://kaize.io/user/blacktidesr/list/animes/completed)
I finished highschool in 2023 at age 17 with a Bachelors Pass. This has allowed me to study Website Development at Eduvos which I am completing in 2025.
I was given many academic awards regarding logical subjects such as mathematics and computer applications technology (or computer literacy to some).
In my final year of highschool I was given a trophy along with 3 cerificates for my contribution to the technical staff of the highschool,
and for achieving the highest computer applications technology mark the school has gotten out of all grade 12's.

I was moderately active as a student, participating in most events and trying out all sports. 
I played for the rugby team from grade 8 to 11. Participated in a netball tournament with my friends, and funnily enough, came second only to the u19 A team, that goes against other schools, by 1 point.
And we only had 2 days of practice to learn all the rules. So that was funny. I tried to get the school to bring volleyball into play as a sport, that half worked but then got disbanded due to funding.
Played soccer and hockey here and there for our Practical Assessment Tasks for Life Orientation. And for events I played piano for our school's choir group and worked backstage for the school's major events,
such as the modelling show, talent shows and university presentations.

Overall I am pretty good at a lot of things, which is due to my life motto. "I want to become a jack of all trades, rather than a master of one."
Right now, even while studying, I am working on game development. So far nothing major, all 2D "mobile" games. I don't exactly have the hardware for something major so yeah.
Eventually I plan to make a well polished passion game. We'll see in the future how that plays out, but yeah. Game development is a side passion I have.

Anyways, if you read this far I'm shocked. Hit me up if you want anime suggestions, or to be random online buddies. 
If you're a person looking to hire me, I appreciate that and wouldn't mind you messaging me, but know that I am still learning and will forever be learning.
PS. I find the whole "needs work experience" thing kinda dumb, because every company needs that, but that stops all of the people from gaining the experience. Just think about it.
Enjoy all your guys' (or girls', or anything in and out of that range) days. <3
